Note the absence now of any symmetries in the flow, though the amplitudes are significantly larger given the proper scaling of the forcing. An argument can be made that the plot of the particle count $N_{p}$ shows roughly when the system is in equilibrium. If you squint, and in some ways that's all Nazarenko and company do, you can see the right cascade rate in (c).}}{5}}
